# Hey! âœ¨

Hello! My name is Daniel Martinez, I'm 26 years old, and I work as a developer-designer in Los Angeles.

## About Me:
I come from an artistic background, having studied graphic design in college, but I found my true calling in web development. I love combining creativity with technical skills to build beautiful and functional websites.

Main areas of focus:
- Frontend development (React, Vue.js)
- UI/UX design (Figma, Adobe XD)
- WordPress for rapid website development

## My Projects:
- **PortfolioSite**: A responsive personal portfolio site showcasing my work.
- **EcoShop**: An online store for eco-friendly products.
- **ArtGallery**: A web app for an online art gallery.

## What I'm Learning Now:
I'm currently exploring Three.js to add 3D elements to my web designs. I'm also experimenting with AR/VR technologies for immersive experiences.

## Hobbies:
I enjoy photography, especially street photography, and I love creating digital art in my spare time. I also play guitar and write songs occasionally.

## How to Reach Me:
If you'd like to discuss your project ideas or just chat about design trends, feel free to reach out!
